SVM algorithm for handwritten digit classification

Solving the SVM optimization problem for handwritten digit classification using a general purpose convex optimization package as well as using a customized solver known as LIBSVM. The general purpose convex optimization package used is [CVXOPT](https://cvxopt.org/) and LIBSVM can be found [here](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm). Linear and Gaussian Kernel are compared for binary classification and Gaussian Kernel is used for multiclass classification.
